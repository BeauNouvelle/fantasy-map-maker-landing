# Privacy Policy
Let's keep this short

## 1.0 Information We Collect
None... kind of.

No information is collection by Fantasy Map Maker other than the anonymous information that Apple collects to show their app analytics to developers.
Apples analytics are collected for ALL apps and there's nothing Fantasy Map Maker can do to stop this, however YOU have the option to disable this feature in the settings app on your device.

To clarify:

No personal information is captured.
No contact information is captured.
No device sensor or identifying information is captured. This includes things like GPS information or what other apps you may have installed on your device.

I just don't do that stuff.
